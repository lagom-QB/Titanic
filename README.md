# Titanic 🛳️

# Questions 🙋
- Where did passengers embark? How many passengers embarked at each stop?
- What was the journey like?

# Plan Of Action 📅
- Group the passengers into 3 classes according to their status (_determined by their titles_)
- Group passengers according to where they boarded
- Build the visualization map

## Note ❗
- For the people who had no information on where they boarded, I assumed they boarded at Belfast; where the ship was built


## Tools used 🧰
- Jupyterlab | Jupyter notebook
- Procreate
