# Titanic 🛳️
[_DataSource_](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/michhar/2dfd2de0d4f8727f873422c5d959fff5/raw/fa71405126017e6a37bea592440b4bee94bf7b9e/titanic.csv)

# Questions 🙋
- Where did passengers embark? How many passengers embarked at each stop?
- What was the journey like?

# Plan Of Action 📅
- Split Passenger Name column to get first name, lastname and title.
- Group the passengers into 3 classes according to their status (_determined by their titles_)
- Group passengers according to where they boarded
- Build the visualization map

## Note ❗
- For the people who had no information on where they boarded, I assumed they boarded at Belfast; where the ship was built


## Tools used 🧰
- Tableau public
- Procreate
